## The World you Live in:
- World Name: Rillyun
- Continent:Zulyra
- Kingdom: Zulyran Kingdom
- Province: Mistin Province
- Town: Malbowen

The Zulyran Kingdom is the power of Zulyra, being a kingdom with six provinces stretching across all the lands. The capital of the Zulyran Kingdom is Hosenga, a castle city that sits atop the Albrigh Mountains. The current king of the Zulyran kingdom is King Farah Zulrya. She has been king for the last three years since the sudden death of her father.
The Mistin Province is one of the smaller, poorer provinces, it is one of the two southern provinces. The capital is Axrowen, a lake city towards the center of Zulyra, and on the border of the neighboring province Feland. The Archduke Hadrian Chaucer has been ruling the Mistin Province for the last 37 years, he travels often around his province but never has he visited the small town of Malbowen. 
Malbowen is a small town with no more than 200 residents, and half of them are from other places recently moved in due to the forced growth. About 20 years ago the Archduke sent the Baron and Baroness, Lord Wesley Arche II and Lady Patricia Arche. With their two kids Wesley Arche III and Fiona Arche, they began the expansion of Malbowen. There was a lot of resistance from the born residence but the Arches showed force and gold, getting the native Malbowens to mostly accept the new change. There hasn’t been any resistance in the last 15 years, except some foul comments spit at the new residence and the old. The Arches live in a mansion on the south side of the town and have brought in new businesses as well as new workers and coin. This steady growth has helped everyone in Malbowen.  Malbowen is located in a large clearing surrounded by the Willow Wilds, a deciduous forest filled with creatures and danger. All natural born residents know not to wander in the Willow Wilds for the forest will take you and never let you go. 
Recent Events: At the last Two Moon Festival Kelly the barmaid was killed in a field not too far from Malbowen, in the Willow Wilds. It is said she was wandering in the Willow Wilds and was killed by wolves.

## Gods and Magic:

For all of your life you were taught the names of the Protectors, the coalition of good gods that protect the material plane and the people in it. You would have never been taught the names of the other two coalitions, The Watchers and The Corruptors, in fear that someone may use them to do evil. It is common belief in Zulyra that the watchers and the corruptors are the one who created arcane magics to fight against the holy magic from the protectors. This idea is slowly dying but there are folks who name the arcane as dark magic. There are two types of magic, the protector’s magic, which is gifted to clerics and paladins, and some bards who use healing magic and smites to ward off evil. Then there is “dark magic” which is everything else. 

### Afterlife: 
It is pretty clear and straightforward, you worship the protectors and do good; follow in their ways. Then you will go to Heaven, Sanctuary,  a land above the material plane where life is filled with peace and adventure.You are fully protected from any corruption and you are free to do as you wish forever. If you are bad and fall to the ways of the Corruptors then you will go to hell, Violation, and burn in eternal darkness. Fighting and dying over and over until you are nothing more than a burned up soul.  

### Holy Days: 
- The day for Church is Cryrs, and each protector gets their own day to be worshiped. Also the Two Moons Festival, and the New year celebrates all of them. 
- Florenzia - The third Cryrs of Radarc.
- Iliahna - The last Cryrs of Drokurs
- Myrkur - The day of the double half moons. This always lands mid- Vroguhs.
- Volir - The 15th of Draull
- Avaos - The 1st of Hizo.

### The Protectors: 

| Name | Domain | Symbol |
| -----| ------ | ------ |
| Florenzia // [Floor-en-Ze-ah] | Sun, Knowledge | Circle with a leaf |
| Iliahna // [Ill-E-an-ah] | Life, Birth | A Dandelion |
| Myrkur // [Meer-Cook] | Moon, Mystery | A Black Half Moon |
| Volir // [Vol-ear] | Faith, Healing | A sun and moon with a dove in between them |
| Avaos // [Ah-Vaye-Oh-s] | Honor, Truth | A sword behind a shield. The shield has an elephant on it. |



### The Watchers: 
They may stay out of the dealings of the common world but they aren't protectors so how good can they be? 

### The Corruptors: 
Whisper thoughts and use dreams to slowly corrupt individuals to do acts of evil. Even though it is the corruptors at hand, those who fall to their lore must be punished for their betrayal and weakness.


## Economy: 
The Zulyran coins have the emblem of Zulyran Kingdom which is a double headed eagle.  With the influx of elves they bring the evish coin which has vines and flowers on it. The coins hold themselves in their weight but some Zulyran establishments will not take the elvish coin. The silver coin is the dollar standard which makes copper a dime, electrum the half dollar, gold ten dollars and platinum the hundred dollar.
