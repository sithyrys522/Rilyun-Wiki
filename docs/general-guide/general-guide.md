The Zulyran Kingdom is the power of Zulyra, being a kingdom with six provinces stretching across all the lands. The capital of the Zulyran Kingdom is Hosenga, a castle city that sits atop the Albrigh Mountains. The current king of the Zulyran kingdom is King Farah Zulrya. She has been king for the last three years since the sudden death of her father.
The Mistin Province is one of the smaller, poorer provinces, it is one of the two southern provinces. The capital is Axrowen, a lake city towards the center of Zulyra, and on the border of the neighboring province Feland. The Archduke Hadrian Chaucer has been ruling the Mistin Province for the last 37 years, he travels often around his province but never has he visited the small town of Malbowen. 
Malbowen is a small town with no more than 200 residents, and half of them are from other places recently moved in due to the forced growth. About 20 years ago the Archduke sent the Baron and Baroness, Lord Wesley Arche II and Lady Patricia Arche. With their two kids Wesley Arche III and Fiona Arche, they began the expansion of Malbowen. There was a lot of resistance from the born residence but the Arches showed force and gold, getting the native Malbowens to mostly accept the new change. There hasnâ€™t been any resistance in the last 15 years, except some foul comments spit at the new residence and the old. The Arches live in a mansion on the south side of the town and have brought in new businesses as well as new workers and coin. This steady growth has helped everyone in Malbowen.  Malbowen is located in a large clearing surrounded by the Willow Wilds, a deciduous forest filled with creatures and danger. All natural born residents know not to wander in the Willow Wilds for the forest will take you and never let you go. 
Recent Events: At the last Two Moon Festival Kelly the barmaid was killed in a field not too far from Malbowen, in the Willow Wilds. It is said she was wandering in the Willow Wilds and was killed by wolves. 

## Economy: 
The Zulyran coins have the emblem of Zulyran Kingdom which is a double headed eagle.  With the influx of elves they bring the evish coin which has vines and flowers on it. The coins hold themselves in their weight but some Zulyran establishments will not take the elvish coin. The silver coin is the dollar standard which makes copper a dime, electrum the half dollar, gold ten dollars and platinum the hundred dollar.
