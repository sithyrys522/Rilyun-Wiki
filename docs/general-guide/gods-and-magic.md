# Gods and Magic:

For all of your life you were taught the names of the Protectors, the coalition of good gods that protect the material plane and the people in it. You would have never been taught the names of the other two coalitions, The Watchers and The Corruptors, in fear that someone may use them to do evil. It is common belief in Zulyra that the watchers and the corruptors are the one who created arcane magics to fight against the holy magic from the protectors. This idea is slowly dying but there are folks who name the arcane as dark magic. There are two types of magic, the protector’s magic, which is gifted to clerics and paladins, and some bards who use healing magic and smites to ward off evil. Then there is “dark magic” which is everything else. 

## Afterlife: 
It is pretty clear and straightforward, you worship the protectors and do good; follow in their ways. Then you will go to Heaven, Sanctuary,  a land above the material plane where life is filled with peace and adventure.You are fully protected from any corruption and you are free to do as you wish forever. If you are bad and fall to the ways of the Corruptors then you will go to hell, Violation, and burn in eternal darkness. Fighting and dying over and over until you are nothing more than a burned up soul.  

## Holy Days: 
- The day for Church is Cryrs, and each protector gets their own day to be worshiped. Also the Two Moons Festival, and the New year celebrates all of them. 
- Florenzia - The third Cryrs of Radarc.
- Iliahna - The last Cryrs of Drokurs
- Myrkur - The day of the double half moons. This always lands mid- Vroguhs.
- Volir - The 15th of Draull
- Avaos - The 1st of Hizo.

## The Watchers: 
They may stay out of the dealings of the common world but they aren't protectors so how good can they be? 

## The Corruptors: 
Whisper thoughts and use dreams to slowly corrupt individuals to do acts of evil. Even though it is the corruptors at hand, those who fall to their lore must be punished for their betrayal and weakness.
